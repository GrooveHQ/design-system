# Getting started

[Groove Storybook Design System (SDS)](https://sds.groovehq.com) is a reusable component library that helps developers build Groove branded, consistent UIs faster. It's an SSOT (single source of truth) for all UI components used across various Groove applications.

## Installing

To use SDS in your project, first install the package:

    yarn add -D @groove/design-system

## Previewing

To see available components, navigate through the sidebar on the left and copy the source code. For instance, to use the `Button` component:

Import it into your UI:

`import { Button } from '@groove/design-system'`

and use it like so:

```
const example = () => (
  <div>
    <Button appearance="primary" onClick={() => 0}>Do something</Button>
  </div>
)
```
