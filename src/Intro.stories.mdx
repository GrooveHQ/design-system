    yarn add @groovehq/design-system

## Previewing

To see available components, navigate through the sidebar on the left and copy the source code. For instance, to use the `Button` component:

Import it into your UI:

`import { Heading } from '@groovehq/design-system'`

and use it like so:

```
const example = () => (
  <div>
    <Heading size="big">Groove Storybook Design System</Heading>
  </div>
)
```
